All that Andrew had done before had not swayed them. But he had finally accepted even death to be human, and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected.

She was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away. But before she faded completely, one final fugitive thought came to him and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped.</font></p></td></tr><tr><td align=right><font face="georgia, times new roman" size=4 color="#bcd398">. <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/nutty_musings/"><font face="georgia, times new roman" size=4 color="#bcd398">Profile Info by NuttyMusings</font></a> .</font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
